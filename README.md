# Python Lessons

This repository contains Python resources for teaching fundamentals in programming to students. The examples folder encloses example code which can be used to show students the capabilities of Python and some more exciting things, the challenges folder contains Python challenges, with set tasks students have to complete. (As well as example code.) 

These can be used to teach basic programming skills and reference for teachers to use. The challenges are ideal to be either printed off or given to students (without example code), they can then attempt to complete that task given the specification/criteria. The extension is designed to push the students knowledge, why not try and come up with your own improvements too?
