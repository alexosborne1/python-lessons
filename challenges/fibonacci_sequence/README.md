Fibonacci Sequence
==================

Goal:
=====

Write a program which prints out the Fibonacci Sequence, starting at 1, up to a set value. The program should allow the user to enter this value.

Fibonacci Sequence:
===================

Each term is generated by adding the previous two terms. The first two terms are 1 and 1 so the third term in 2. 
E.g.
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

5 is obtained by adding 2 + 3.

Extension:
==========
- Print the sum of the terms output.
